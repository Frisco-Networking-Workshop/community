# star tracker

 * would require robotics
 * need a camera feed
 * some type of embedded board (beagle board, ardrino, rpi)

# reddit/stock/crypto bot
> bot controlled pump and dump scheme
  * need a bot that creates users and posts to reddit to create hype around a stock/crypto
  * need a bot to buy and sell those stocks/cryptos
  
  Gabe: I have one of these almost entirely built just needs finishing up. Minus the chat. The amount of anonymyzing of ourselves we'd had to do is hard and already possibly shot due to this page right here :)

# Artiste [Music][AI]

 * train on rap lyrics to learn to rhyme
 * correlate soundwav files with the music behind them and the lyrics
 
# Library of Babel [Blockchain][AI]
