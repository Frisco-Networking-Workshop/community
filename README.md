# Community

Community Discussion &amp; Planning

This is designed to be a group of like minded people with similiar skills who want to build things outside of working for the man! This is the incubation stage so we have a lot to figure out how to make this work. The idea would be to meet maybe once a month (optional) just to get together and hang out and see actual faces while eating and planning our next month. From there hopefully we can take a lesson from the opensource community and figure out how to finish something with the need for minimal meetings and what have ya! This is supposed to be a group for everyone to want to be apart of so please share your ideas! Ideally would like to hold our first meeting by May.

# WELCOME!

Read [contribution guide](/CONTRIBUTE.md) first.
Add your ideas to [idea file](/IDEAS.md).

# Recruiting

We need people. More importantly people with different skill sets would allow us to get into more project possibilities. If you know someone that can join please say something.

# First Order of Business
While I/WE try and figure out how this will work we need to start getting some ideas on the board for possible projects to work on. Anyone can add one or add comments/info to someone elses. This is to be opening discussion.
